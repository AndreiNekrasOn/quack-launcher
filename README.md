# Sway speech launcher

A small script that neither I, nor anybody else, will ever use, but it's here anyway.

This is mostly snippets of other people's code glued together:

- https://github.com/openai/whisper
- https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/

Both of those are MIT Licence.

If, for some reason, you want to use this, you'll need to edit the `launch` function.

You must have `whisper`, `pyaudio`, `wave` installed.
